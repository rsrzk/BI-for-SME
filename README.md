# BI-for-SME
BI for SME web app created for work at V-Cred. Deployed and gave access to 2 SME (small & medium-sized enterprise) clients for early-stage prototyping purposes.

Purpose: For sharing of business intelligence reports to SME customers to test product desirability and feasibility.

Problem statement: SMEs often lack access to analysis on their business data. V-Cred was attempting to solve this problem by providing data analysis services to SMEs at affordable prices.
